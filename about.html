<h1>Martin Otis</h1>
    <p>I have over 16 years of web development experience including web site planning and implementation, as well as engagements in the greater WordPress community. I was actively involved in the testing and development of WordPress Core Version 3.0 for the WordPress Core Development Team, have authored WordPress plug-ins and themes and continue to remain engaged in helping others learn the platform by participating in discussions in the online WordPress Forums.</p>
    <p>I received Bachelor of Science degrees in both Art History and Studio Art from Knox Collegeâ€”where I also studied philosophy under the guidance of Visiting Professor Susan Sontag.</p>
    <p>When not developing websites or brands for wines and spirits, I spend an inordinate amount of time foraging for wild edibles and devising tasty recipes for the table using them.</p>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mushroom hunting</li>
        <li>Cooking vegetarian and vegan foods</li>
        <li>Creating "primitive brews" utilizing found and foraged ingredients utilizing wild yeasts</li>
    </ul>
